The standard format of DREAM documentation as of April 5 (2015) is PDF
create by combination of `pmlatex.sty' and `pdflatex'.  This program
helps to upload and re-upload the PDF file.  This program has four
sub-command, that are add, commit, update, and scan.

Whenever you finish writing document the first time, you need four
steps; (1) create a bib record in Medusa with appropriate title, date,
and author, (2) embed Medusa-ID into the LaTeX document and recompile
it, (3) upload the PDF file to the bib record, and (4) correlate the
bib record with stones shown up on the document.

On revision the document, you need three steps; (1) remove PDF file
that is correlated with the bib record, (2) update title, date, and
author of the record when necessary, and (3) upload the newest PDF
file.

This program assists those complicated procedures.  Note that this
program reads `~/.orochirc' for Medusa configuration.

      example = <<-EOS 
Let's assume you have finished writing
`report.tex'.  You invoke `pmlatex add report'.  The program scans the
document and picks title, date, and author, and create a new bib on
Medusa.  At the same time, it inserts letters
`\BibliographySisyphus{20140806114754-746408}' into `report.tex'.  You
recompile `report.tex'.  You will correlate the bib record and stones,
boxes, and analyses shown up on the document.  Hereafter, only stones
are inferred for simple explanation.  You invoke `pmlatex scan
report'.  The program scans the document, picks stones, and correlate
the bib record to the stones.  It also exports stones to `report.ss'.
By handling the `report.ss' appropriately, you re-correlate the bib
record and the stones.  Then you invoke `pmlatex commit report' to
upload the PDF file to the bib record.  The commands you invoked on
this scene are summarized as below.

 $ pmlatex add report
 $ pdflatex report
 $ pmlatex scan report
 $ pmlatex commit report

Whenever you revise `report.tex' and have the up-to-date `report.pdf',
you want to replace `report.pdf' on Medusa by the newest PDF.  You
invoke `pmlatex commit report' to do so.  You may want to update
title, author, and date on the bib record.  You invoke `pmlatex update
report' to do so.  The commands you invoked on this scene are
summarized as below.

 $ pmlatex commit report
 $ pmlatex update report
